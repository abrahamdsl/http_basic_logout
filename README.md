http_basic_logout
=================

A set of files for HTTP Basic logout mechanism. Specifically designed for the internal project I am working on with my company but you can easily customize it to suit your needs.

Just place it on say, a `site_logout` folder in your web server's directory then access it via <domain>/site_logout .
